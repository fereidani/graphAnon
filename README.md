### Introduction
<a name="introduction" ></a>

This is the GraphAnon software suite, version 2.0, with software for 
transforming a graph into supergraphs that are 
resistance to identity and attribute disclosure attacks. 
For more details about _attribute disclosure attacks_, you are
encouraged to read the short article, which presents the material 
implemented in the _attribute mode_ of this software:

> S. Chester and G. Srivastava. 2011. "Social network privacy for
>   attribute disclosure attacks." In: Proceedings of the 2011
>   International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis
>   and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 445-449. 
>		doi: [10.1109/ASONAM.2011.105](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2011.105)

For more details about _identity disclosure attacks_, you are 
encouraged to read either of the following articles (the 
conference version or the expanded journal version), which presents 
the material implemented in the _identity mode_ of this software:

> S. Chester et al. 2013. "Why Waldo befriended the dummy? 
>   k-Anonymization of social networks with pseudo-nodes." 
>   Social Network Analysis and Mining 3(3): 381-399. Springer Vienna. 
>   doi: [10.1007/s13278-012-0084-6](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13278-012-0084-6)

------------------------------------
### Requirements
<a name="requirements" ></a>

GraphAnon relies on the following packages/libraries:

 * OpenMP for to parallelise the calculation of graph statistics
 * C++ 11 for newer STL containers such as unordered_set
 * CMake (version 3.4 or higher) for auto-generating a makefile


------------------------------------
### Installation
<a name="installation" ></a>

GraphAnon is built using `CMake`. Create an out-of-source directory 
(e.g., `bin/` or `debug/`) and then run `cmake ../src` to generate a makefile. 
Then run `make` to build the executable. You can optionally run `cmake` 
with the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` options to 
compile explicitly in _debug_ (for development) or _release_ (for performance) 
modes, respectively.

To clean the project, you can simply delete the out-of-source directory that 
you created; e.g., `rm -rf bin`.


------------------------------------
### Input data format
<a name="data-format" ></a>

The default input format is an _adjacency list_ format. 
The first line gives the number of vertices in the file.
Each subsequent line _i_ includes a space-separated list of all nodes _j_ for which the edge _(i,j)_ exists, 
beginning with _i=0_.
For example, the (undirected) [Diamond Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_graph), with nodes numbered 
anti-clockwise starting from the bottom-most node, would be represented by the following adjacency list:

```
4
1 2 3
0 2
0 1 3
1 3
```

More examples can be found in the `workloads/` directory.



------------------------------------
### Documentation
<a name="documentation" ></a>

The code has been documented for `doxygen`. If the `doc/html/` 
directory is empty or stale, you can regenerate the documentation 
by running `doxygen Doxyfile` from within the `doc/` subdirectory.
The `doxygen` settings are included in `doc/Doxyfile` and can be 
freely modified to suit your preferences.
